## Support Vector Machines (SVM)
(SVM) is a powerful machine learning algorithm that is widely used for classification tasks. SVMs can be used for binary classification, multi-class classification, and even regression tasks.

### Here are the general steps to calculate classification with SVM using a CSV file as input:

1. Load the CSV file: You can use a library like Pandas to load the CSV file into a DataFrame.


Split the data: Split the data into a training set and a test set. The training set will be used to train the SVM, and the test set will be used to evaluate the performance of the SVM.

Preprocess the data: Preprocess the data by scaling the features to have zero mean and unit variance. This step is important to ensure that all features have equal importance in the SVM.

Train the SVM: Use the training data to train the SVM. You can use a library like scikit-learn to train an SVM.

Evaluate the performance of the SVM: Use the test set to evaluate the performance of the SVM. You can use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to evaluate the performance of the SVM.

Here's some sample code to help you get started with implementing SVM in Python using scikit-learn:
